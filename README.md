The AI NourishBot app is a smart dietary assistant that uses advanced AI models to analyze food images and generate helpful nutritional insights or personalized recipe ideas based on user preferences. Here's a quick recap of what the app does:

Food Image Analysis:

Upload an image of any food item, and the app will analyze the contents to provide a detailed nutrient breakdown, including:
Calories
Macronutrients (protein, carbs, fats)
Micronutrients (vitamins, minerals)
Personalized Recipe Suggestions:

For users with specific dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, gluten-free), the app can filter ingredients and generate creative recipe ideas using only the allowed ingredients.
It ensures that the suggested recipes are healthy, easy to prepare, and aligned with the user's dietary needs.
Dietary Filtering:

The app takes into account dietary restrictions such as:
Vegan
Vegetarian
Gluten-free
Keto
It filters out ingredients that don't comply with the specified diet.
Health Evaluation:

Once the nutrient analysis is complete, the app provides a summary of the meal's healthiness, along with suggestions for improving its nutritional balance.
User-Friendly Interface:

The app offers an intuitive, easy-to-use web interface built using Gradio, where users can:
Upload an image of their meal
Specify dietary preferences (optional)
Choose a workflow: either "Recipe" or "Analysis"
Two Main Workflows:

Recipe Workflow: Generates recipe ideas using the detected ingredients and dietary restrictions.
Analysis Workflow: Provides detailed nutritional information and health insights for the uploaded food image.
This app is designed for anyone looking to maintain a healthy diet, experiment with new recipes, or get quick insights into their meals—all powered by AI!
